4) Development of Internet of Things sensor monitoring based on IEEE 802.15.4, MICAz and Android

IEEE 802.15.4 is a wireless standard for low power low bit rate applications. The MICAz mote includes an IEEE 802.15.4 radio chip, which operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band. The objective of the project is to monitor a MICAz motes equipped with movement detection sensors. Movement sensor alarms are sent to a web server through a gateway running on a PC. Other MICAz motes equipped with an MTS300 board activate a buzzer upon alarm detection. An Android App will also be developed, which acesses the server and displays alarm events to the user. It also allows the configuration of the buzzers.
